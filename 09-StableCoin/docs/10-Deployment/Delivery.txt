https://ropsten.etherscan.io/tx/0x8a77547fd4b105310d791902541502319fd19d5d08ceebcaa67e7ed803795d9b

Here is your GenTech token.
https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x4125ec95d59a2d29c9314f113fe26d2b266db455

In order to deploy with you as owner. Kindly follow the steps

1) Open http://remix.ethereum.org
2) Copy paste the attached contract
3) First, deploy Mock Oracle contract
4) Once deployed set price 15626 (in cents) whatever the current rates. Later you can build oracle to set up live rates
5) Deploy the GenTech contract now.
6) Use Mock Oracle contract address as a parameter to deploy.
7) Flush with ethereum to get GenTech Token against ether.

Here is the example to understand the functionality

For Example
1) A user deposits 1 Ether when the price of Ether is $140
2) The price then falls to $ 70.
3) If we have enough Ether in the contract we cover their losses and pay them back 2 ether (the same amount in USD).
4) if we don't have enough money to pay them back we pay out proportionally to what we have left. In this case, they'd get back their original deposit of 1 Ether.
